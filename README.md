# newtab.eth

It's a new tab site for you browser. Not mobile friendly!! (yet?)

**Made with love. \<3**

## Goals

- [x] I had fun building this (so far)
- [x] Experiment with UX
- [ ] More customization: be able to remove and re-add the links container
- [ ] Automated testing...
- [ ] 3rd party widget system: not sure how feasible this would be atm but imagine standalone components you can drop into the site (weather or clock embeds, etc.)
- [ ] Cross-device synced dashboard (will need to support mobile for this) (might become a different project)

## Usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Thanks Zucc!
